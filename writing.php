		<div class="quotecontent">
		<p>Question: The mantis shrimp can perceive both polarized light and multispectral images; they have the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. Human eyes have color receptors for three colors (red, green, and blue); the mantis shrimp has receptors for sixteen types of color, enabling them to see a spectrum far beyond the capacity of the human brain. Seriously, how cool is the mantis shrimp: mantisshrimp.uchicago.edu What might they be able to see that we cannot? What are we missing?</p>
		<p>Interestingly, the three color receptors humans possess happen to coincide with the number of dimensions in space, so therefore humans can be considered 3-dimensional beings of both space and color. Under this definition, mantis shrimps would be living in a 16-dimensional world of vision. </p>

		<p>March 1, 2011 - I came across a post on the school forum with this ambiguous title. It is from a familiar user, so I click into it only to discover an empty post. Skimming across the meaningless comments from other users, I smile before clicking the red X on the upright corner. Must be the academic stress of the season.</p>
		<p>I have connected with him several times before without knowing who he really is at school--once to clarify the "monotonicity" of derivative functions, and another time debating over the effectiveness of a new school policy on mobile phones. Each time, he managed to convince me with his insightful reasoning. From our conversations, I deemed him an interesting person, amongst those few we encounter in life. However, beyond the whimsical discussions online, we never interacted further.</p>

		<div class="quotecontent">
		<p><span class=italicized>In the past several years there is an impulse that influences my decisions, including my decision to study abroad. Yet I cannot figure out what it is. It bothers me so I decide to try a unique method from Steve Pavlina to address it.</span></p>
		<p>I close the window and curtains, preventing even a single beam of sunlight from entering. I turn off Bach's organ concerto that has been playing on my sound box, along with my cell phone and computer. The room is drenched in complete darkness and silence, inducing a serene paradise for introspection.</p>
		<p>On a large piece of paper, I scrawl blindly, "WHAT DO I WANT IN LIFE?" I feel funny about what I am doing--thinking about such big matters in such big letters. My mood then is light-hearted.</p>
