My personal website
This was initially a class project yet I decided to continue developing it into a full personal website. 

For detailed info on design specifics, checkout my <a href="https://github.com/Shangyuanniu/shangyuanniu.com/blob/master/P1rationale.pdf">Design Rationale</a> for this site.

This site is not live yet, but will be soon. I'm planning to use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for hosting. Quite convenient, isn't it.
